# Java-Snow-Day-Calculator
This is a simple class that parses information from http://snowdaycalculator.com and returns it in a usable format.

See SnowDayTest.java for example usage.

The parameters of the SnowDayCalculator constructor are the same as ones found the website itself. The first parameter is the zipcode of the area you wish to see the prediction of. The second parameter is the amount of snowdays that the school has already had. The third parameter is the type of the school. Based on my tests, these last two parameters only slightly change the results, but I still felt the need to include them in case you wish specify them.
